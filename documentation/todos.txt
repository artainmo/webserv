setup multiple servers with different port
setup multiple servers with different host name
setup default error page

3)Headers
Open the RFC 7231 and check the list of header of the subject, ask questions about it.

4)PORT
Multiple ports for one server?
Multiple ports for one server same port error
Multiple server with same port, if one server does not work use next one
