Create own basic test in frontend with proper .conf to show what happens when file not found, method not found, search a directory with potential index.html…

0) CODE

Search for all read/recv/write/send on a socket and check that if an error returned the client is removed \

Search for all read/recv/write/send and check if the returned value is well checked. (checking only -1 or 0 is not good you should check both) \

1)CONF
Parse the multiple servers \
setup multiple servers with different ports \
setup multiple servers with different host name \
Multiple servers fast version \
setup default error page (try to change the error 404) \
Protection default error page \

3)Headers
Open the RFC 7231 and check the list of header of the subject, ask questions about it.

4)PORT
Multiple ports for one server \
Same host and server protection \

5)SIEGE
launch the installation of siege with homebrew \

SIEGE is used to stress test -> memory leak, never hanging connection, server never dies… \
You should be able to use siege indefinitly without restarting the server (look at siege -b) +- 
Availability should be above 99.5% for a simple get on an empty page with a siege -b on that page +-
